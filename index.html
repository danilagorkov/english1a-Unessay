            <p class="bio">Danila Gorkov is a student at Foothill College studying Computer Science for transfer. In addition to analyzing patterns of academic success, Danila wrote a BIAW essay for ENGL 1A that demonstrates a relationship between failure in writing and success in writing. Danila is closely associated with the process of failure, as English is not his primary language. He uses a failure algorithm that allows utilizing failure as a resource for a finer understanding of the subject.
