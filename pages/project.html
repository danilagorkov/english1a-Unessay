        <p>FAILURE IS ESSENTIAL TO WRITING</p>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          We try to avoid failure at all costs and think that we are the only
          ones who ever give up. And what's worse, we're afraid we'll never be
          able to punch back. However, many people realize over time that their
          biggest struggles have become their most important life lessons.

          In the research titled “‘Fail better’: Reconsidering the role of
          struggle and failure in academic writing development in higher
          education” Amanda French argues that the process of failure is
          undervalued in modern society. She believes that failure always
          teaches you to analyze. If you do not want to repeat your mistakes,
          you will have to understand why they happened. Similarly when reading
          scholarly text many students fail because they are unable to
          comprehend or analyze the text for important details and ideas.
          Without comprehension the student does not possess the ability to
          transfer his knowledge on paper and collaborate with other students.

          <p class="question">
            Can failure lead to success? According to the theory of Manu Kapur
            this process revolves around 4 stages.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              in order to solve a task the person requires the use of previously
              acquired knowledge and skills
            </li>
            <li>
              search for solutions sparks excitement, curiosity, and interest
            </li>
            <li>
              students realize what information they have and try to apply it
            </li>
            <li>
              they fail multiple times before coming up with a unique solution
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The main thing is to get a negative experience with maximum benefit.
            You must be able to analyze each of your failures. Be prepared for
            failures, because they are the predictors of success. And the more
            stunning and serious the failure, the stronger and louder your
            success will be in the future.

            At first glance, the idea that failures come from working
            effectively seems absurd. Of course, every mistake made gives a
            person experience, but how does it manifest itself in motivation?

            "When asked if failure had and will typically lead to growth and
            improvements personally and/or in their daily career roles on the
            member checking survey, 69 of the 78 respondents (88%)
            agreed."(Amber Simpson and Adam Maltese , 1)

          <p>
            Utilizing interview data with professionals across STEM Amber
            Simpson and Adam Maltese were able to support their claim that
            failure leads to success. The majority of interviewed people
            reported that failure helped them to adjust their workflow and
            improve their motivation. Failure provided them with skills that
            helped them with further education and employment.
