          In her commencement speech at Harvard University in 2008 JK Rowling
          identifies her greatest fear as the fear of failure. In her opinion
          the fear of failure is comeletely normal as long as it is contained.
          The fact that you have faced failure means that you can start doing
          something about it or find people who possess more knowledge than you.

          In her TedTalk Barbara Corcoran discusses the difference between the
          person who tries and fails, and the person who never tries. She uses
          examples from her life to justify the importance of failure to achieve
          success in the future.
